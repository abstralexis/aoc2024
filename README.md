# aoc2024
I'm doing this as part of a University leaderboard, so the code may look very rushed. I like doing solutions that are
nice and organised but that may not happen this year! I was contemplating using Go this year to learn it, but I just 
could not wrap my head around the tooling. Most of these solutions will be in Rust, or Java if I'm feeling particularly
daring.
## Why have I done X?
Because I wanted to. I added `rayon` to dependencies in case I want to make things faster, and I might
add `tokio` too.
